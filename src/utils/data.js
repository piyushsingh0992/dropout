    Welcome to neogcamp's second class. For a newbie to self host his/her first website and program more apps we need some tooling to be in place. Tools help you make your life easier. All these tools are free for you and will give you a better place to code, a place to store your code in the cloud so that you don't lose it, and then a place to host your app so that others can find it. 
    
    This session will set you up for the next class where we'll develop our very own portfolio website and blog. The blog part will be an assignment but I'll help you with that. 
    
    For intermediate to advanced developers, if you already know how to use Git, Github, VSCode, Netlify, etc to do web development you can skip this class.
